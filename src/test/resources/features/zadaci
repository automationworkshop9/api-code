Notes:
Install following plugins in InteliJ:
- Cucumber for Java
- Gherkin

---
1. Debug and fix test : User is able to sell a pet in status pending
    - although test passes, status of the pet is incorrect after the execution (AVAILABLE instead of PENDING)
2. Debug and fix test : User is able to remove pet from the Pet Store
    - test is failing in the second step for unknown reason
3. Create a new feature file (user_management) and two new scenarios:
    - Scenario_1 should test if a user can be updated in the application
        -- make sure to use soft assertions in @Then (assertJ)
    - Scenario_2 should test if a user can be deleted from the application
